	A critical server tied to Jester, the rogue AI, was compromised. Investigators recovered the Master File Table (MFT) from the NTFS partition, revealing a secret clue. The attackers left a secret file on the Desktop. Can you analyze the MFT, uncover their activities, and track down the file?

        > 1. What is the MFT entry number of the secret file ?
        > 2. What is the size of the secret file in bytes ?  
        > 3. What is the creation time of the secret file in UTC ? (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
